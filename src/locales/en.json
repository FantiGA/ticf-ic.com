    "line1": "We believe the Bible is the verbally inspired Word of God, without error and infallible in the original manuscripts. We believe the Bible is the final authority in faith and life (2 Timothy 3:15-17; 2 Peter 1:20; Psalm 19:7-9).",
    "line2": "We believe there is one God, existing eternally in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and possessing the same attributes and perfections (Genesis 1:1; Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 28:19; John 10:30; 2 Corinthians 13:14).",
    "line3": "We believe that we are created in the image and likeness of God, in innocence, and without sin. In Adam’s sin humanity fell, inherited a sinful nature, and became spiritually dead and alienated from God. We believe that, within ourselves, we are incapable of redeeming ourselves from our lost and depraved condition (Genesis 1:26, 3:1-24, Romans 3:10-18, 5:12, Ephesians 2:1-3).",
    "line4": "In addition, we believe that God created humankind - male and female - equally in God’s own image. This divinely determined distinction is good, proper, and to be celebrated. Maleness and femaleness are biologically determined at conception and are not subject to change. We affirm God’s design for marriage, which is for one woman and one man living in one-flesh, covenantal and sexual relationship until the separation by death (Genesis 1.26-28; 2.24,25;4.1; Matthew 19.3-6; 1 Corinthians 6.9-11; 1 Peter 3.1-7).",
    "line5": "We believe that Jesus Christ is God (John 10:33). We believe in: His virgin birth (Isaiah 7:17; Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:34-35); His sinless life (Hebrews 4:15,7:26); His miracles (John 2:11); His vicarious and atoning death (I Corinthians 15:3; Ephesians 1:7; Hebrews 2:9); His resurrection (John 11:25; 1 Corinthians 15:4); His ascension to the right hand of the Father (Mark 16:19); His personal return to earth in power and glory (Acts 1:11; Revelation 19:11-16).",
    "line6": "We believe that the Holy Spirit, the Third Person of the Trinity, dwells in every true believer (1 Corinthians 3:16; 2 Corinthians 6:16-17). We believe that the Holy Spirit seals and indwells every believer, spiritually uniting all with one another (Ephesians 1:13; 1 Corinthians 12:13; Romans 8:9; Galatians 3:26-28).",
    "line7": "We believe the Holy Spirit enables the trusting obedient believer to live a godly life (Romans 8:13-14; I Corinthians 3:16, 6:19-20; Ephesians 4:30, 5:18) and continues to endow believers with gifts for the purpose of building up the body, for the common good, just as the Holy Spirit wills (1 Corinthians l2: 4-11).",
    "line8": "We believe that we are created in the image and likeness of God, in innocence, and without sin. In Adams’s sin humanity fell, inherited a sinful nature, became spiritually dead and alienated from God. We believe that, within ourselves, we are incapable of redeeming ourselves from our lost and depraved condition (Genesis 1:26; 3:1-24; Romans 3:10-18, 5:12, Ephesians 2:1-3).",
    "line9": "We believe that God’s eternal Son, Jesus Christ, became man, without ceasing to be God, in order to reveal God and redeem sinful humankind. We believe Christ voluntarily offered Himself as our sacrificial substitute on the cross, satisfying God’s righteous judgment against sin. We believe God’s only provision for our sin is Christ’s death on our behalf, through which God reconciles us to Godself (John 14:6; Acts 4:12; 2 Corinthians 5:21).",
    "line10": "We believe that salvation from the penalty of sin is a gift of God’s grace. We believe that salvation cannot be gained by any work and is provided on the single ground of trust in Christ’s work on the cross. All who trust Christ in this way are forgiven of their sins and born into God’s family by the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit (John 3:16-19; Romans 3:23; 5:1-9; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5).",
    "line11": "We believe that the church, called in Scripture the Body of Christ, is a spiritual organism and that every true believer is a member of His Body. We also believe that Scripture affirms the establishment and continuation of local churches, where groups of Christian believers are called together for worship, instruction, fellowship, and service (Ephesians 1:22, 23; 1 Corinthians 12:13; Acts 2:42, 13:1).",
    "line12": "We believe that after death, the souls of all who trust in Christ for salvation enter Christ’s presence, awaiting the resurrection of life. We believe that after death the souls of all who do not trust Christ for salvation enter into conscious separation from God, awaiting the resurrection of condemnation, the eternal consequence of unbelief (Luke 16:19-26, 2 Corinthians 5:8, Philippians 1:23, 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9, Hebrews 9:27, Revelation 20:11-15)."
