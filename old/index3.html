				<span class="barlow fnt-about statement" style="vertical-align: middle;">OUR FAITH STATEMENT</span>
			</div>
			<p class="g1">The Scriptures</p>
			<p class="ab-p2">We believe the Bible is the verbally inspired Word of God, without error and infallible in the
				original manuscripts. We believe the Bible is the final authority in faith and life (2 Timothy 3:15-17; 2 Peter
				1:20; Psalm 19:7-9).</p>
			<br />
			<p class="g1">God</p>
			<p class="ab-p2">We believe there is one God, existing eternally in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
				and possessing the same attributes and perfections (Genesis 1:1; Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 28:19; John 10:30; 2
				Corinthians 13:14).<br>
				We believe that we are created in the image and likeness of God, in innocence, and without sin. In Adam’s sin
				humanity fell, inherited a sinful nature, and became spiritually dead and alienated from God. We believe that,
				within ourselves, we are incapable of redeeming ourselves from our lost and depraved condition (Genesis 1:26,
				3:1-24, Romans 3:10-18, 5:12, Ephesians 2:1-3).<br>
				In addition, we believe that God created humankind – male and female – equally in God’s own image. This divinely
				determined distinction is good, proper, and to be celebrated. Maleness and femaleness are biologically
				determined at conception and are not subject to change. We affirm God’s design for marriage, which is for one
				woman and one man living in one-flesh, covenantal and sexual relationship until the separation by death (Genesis
				1.26-28; 2.24,25;4.1; Matthew 19.3-6; 1 Corinthians 6.9-11; 1 Peter 3.1-7).</p>
			<br />
			<p class="g1">Jesus Christ</p>
			<p class="ab-p2">We believe that Jesus Christ is God (John 10:33). We believe in: His virgin birth (Isaiah 7:17;
				Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:34-35); His sinless life (Hebrews 4:15,7:26); His miracles (John 2:11); His vicarious and
				atoning death (I Corinthians 15:3; Ephesians 1:7; Hebrews 2:9); His resurrection (John 11:25; 1 Corinthians
				15:4); His ascension to the right hand of the Father (Mark 16:19); His personal return to earth in power and
				glory (Acts 1:11; Revelation 19:11-16).</p>
			<br />
			<p class="g1">The Holy Spirit</p>
			<p class="ab-p2">We believe that the Holy Spirit, the Third Person of the Trinity, dwells in every true believer
				(1 Corinthians 3:16; 2 Corinthians 6:16-17). We believe that the Holy Spirit seals and indwells every believer,
				spiritually uniting all with one another (Ephesians 1:13; 1 Corinthians 12:13; Romans 8:9; Galatians
				3:26-28).<br>
				We believe the Holy Spirit enables the trusting obedient believer to live a godly life (Romans 8:13-14; I
				Corinthians 3:16, 6:19-20; Ephesians 4:30, 5:18) and continues to endow believers with gifts for the purpose of
				building up the body, for the common good, just as the Holy Spirit wills (1 Corinthians l2: 4-11).</p>
			<br />
			<p class="g1">The Condition of People</p>
			<p class="ab-p2">We believe that we are created in the image and likeness of God, in innocence, and without sin.
				In Adams’s sin humanity fell, inherited a sinful nature, became spiritually dead and alienated from God. We
				believe that, within ourselves, we are incapable of redeeming ourselves from our lost and depraved condition
				(Genesis 1:26; 3:1-24; Romans 3:10-18, 5:12, Ephesians 2:1-3).</p>
			<br />
			<p class="g1">The Work of Christ</p>
			<p class="ab-p2">We believe that God’s eternal Son, Jesus Christ, became man, without ceasing to be God, in order
				to reveal God and redeem sinful humankind. We believe Christ voluntarily offered Himself as our sacrificial
				substitute on the cross, satisfying God’s righteous judgment against sin. We believe God’s only provision for
				our sin is Christ’s death on our behalf, through which God reconciles us to Godself (John 14:6; Acts 4:12; 2
				Corinthians 5:21).</p>
			<br />
			<p class="g1">Salvation</p>
			<p class="ab-p2">We believe that salvation from the penalty of sin is a gift of God’s grace. We believe that
				salvation cannot be gained by any work and is provided on the single ground of trust in Christ’s work on the
				cross. All who trust Christ in this way are forgiven of their sins and born into God’s family by the
				regenerating work of the Holy Spirit (John 3:16-19; Romans 3:23; 5:1-9; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5).</p>
			<br />
			<p class="g1">The Church</p>
			<p class="ab-p2">We believe that the church, called in Scripture the Body of Christ, is a spiritual organism and
				that every true believer is a member of His Body. We also believe that Scripture affirms the establishment and
				continuation of local churches, where groups of Christian believers are called together for worship,
				instruction, fellowship, and service (Ephesians 1:22, 23; 1 Corinthians 12:13; Acts 2:42, 13:1).</p>
			<br />
			<p class="g1">Eternal State</p>
			<p class="ab-p2">We believe that after death, the souls of all who trust in Christ for salvation enter Christ’s
				presence, awaiting the resurrection of life. We believe that after death the souls of all who do not trust
				Christ for salvation enter into conscious separation from God, awaiting the resurrection of condemnation, the
				eternal consequence of unbelief (Luke 16:19-26, 2 Corinthians 5:8, Philippians 1:23, 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9,
				Hebrews 9:27, Revelation 20:11-15).</p>
